    description: "The Peugeot 206 was introduced as the successor to the highly successful 205, becoming one of Peugeot's most popular models with over 8.3 million units produced globally. The exterior featured distinctive styling with large headlights, a small grille, and a rounded overall design that proved appealing across diverse markets. Initially available as three and five-door hatchbacks, the range later expanded to include the 206 CC (Coupe Cabriolet) with an innovative folding metal roof, the 206 SW station wagon, and the 206 Sedan in developing markets. Powertrain options varied widely by market but typically included gasoline engines ranging from 1.0L to 2.0L and diesel engines from 1.4L to 2.0L, with transmission choices including 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic. The high-performance GTi and later GTi 180 models offered up to 180 horsepower, though they never quite achieved the iconic status of the 205 GTi. The interior was relatively simple but functional, with a center-mounted instrument cluster on some versions. A significant refresh in 2003 brought updated styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced safety features. The 206 achieved considerable motorsport success, winning the World Rally Championship in 2000, 2001, and 2002 with the 206 WRC. Despite being replaced by the 207 in most European markets by 2006, the 206 continued production in various forms and markets until 2012, and even longer in some regions through licensed production. The 206's combination of distinctive styling, diverse body options, and value positioning made it a global success story for Peugeot, particularly strong in Europe, South America, and Middle Eastern markets."
