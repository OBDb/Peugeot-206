    description: "The original Peugeot 206 was introduced in September 1998 as the successor to the legendary 205, representing a new generation of Peugeot superminis. Built on the PSA PF1 platform, it featured distinctive styling with large headlights and a rounded design. Available initially as 3-door and 5-door hatchbacks, the range expanded to include the 206 CC coupe-cabriolet with a folding steel roof (2000), the 206 SW station wagon (2002), and the 206 SD sedan for developing markets like Iran (2005). Engine options ranged from 1.1L to 2.0L petrol and 1.4L to 2.0L diesel, with the high-performance GTi (130hp) and later GTi 180/RC (180hp) variants becoming modern classics. A minor cosmetic facelift in 2003 brought updated headlights, rear clusters, and interior revisions. The 206 achieved motorsport success, winning the World Rally Championship manufacturers' and drivers' titles in 2000 and 2002. Replaced by the 207 in European markets in April 2006, but continued production globally until 2008."

    description: "The facelifted Peugeot 206, marketed as the 206+ in Europe (2009-2013) and 207 Compact/207 Brasil in South America (2008-2017), featured a significant restyle with a new front end and styling similar to the Peugeot 207. The redesign included revised headlights, bumper, grille, and interior appointments bringing it in line with Peugeot's newer design language. Production continued at the Mulhouse plant in France for European markets, while South American production (Argentina, Brazil) extended well beyond 2012. The facelifted model was offered in hatchback, station wagon, and sedan body styles. In Iran, a related version called the 207i was produced under license by Iran Khodro (IKCO), with a second series launched in 2017 using locally sourced parts. This extended production run made the 206 one of Peugeot's longest-lived single generation models, with over 8.3 million units produced globally by 2012."
